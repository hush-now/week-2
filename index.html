        <dd>  In the second week, our group determined each person's specific tasks and simultaneously began searching and reading relevant literature. We have clarified the tasks for the next few weeks, among which Teacher Li Qi mentioned that we need to complete some of our literature reading first, while also considering the feasibility of the entire machine. At the same time, we need to complete some relevant calculations in advance in order to carry out the work more efficiently in the future.
In addition, this week coincides with China's Teachers' Day, and the Hush now group wishes all teachers a happy holiday and good health.
