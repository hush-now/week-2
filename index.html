        <dd>  In the second week, our group determined each person's specific tasks and simultaneously began searching and reading relevant literature. We have clarified the tasks for the next few weeks, among which Teacher Li Qi mentioned that we need to complete some of our literature reading first, while also considering the feasibility of the entire machine. At the same time, we need to complete some relevant calculations in advance in order to carry out the work more efficiently in the future.
In addition, this week coincides with China's Teachers' Day, and the Hush now group wishes all teachers a happy holiday and good health.

        <dd>  The main goal of the snake shaped detection robot project is to design a robot that can detect and transmit real-time signals in complex terrain conditions. This robot is mainly used for exploring terrain and personnel in collapsed areas after earthquakes. The robot will use an acoustic signal collection device to collect sound and transmit the obtained information using its own communication device, in order to obtain information about the shape, size, and terrain under dark conditions of the object. The robot will have the following main functions:
Acoustic signal collection device: The robot is equipped with high-frequency acoustic signal sensors, which can emit sound waves and receive echo signals. By capturing various sounds and transmitting the information back to the rear computer, it is converted into digital signals for processing and analysis. Motion Control System: Robots have a special motion system that mimics the movement of snakes in order to enter gaps that cannot be accessed by humans. The robot receives remote control signals sent by the remote control through a receiver, and can achieve various movements such as forward and turning through control. At the same time, in the face of complex environments, the detector should have navigation and positioning functions, and correct the direction of movement based on the detected terrain data. Communication and remote control system: The detection robot will be equipped with communication modules to achieve wireless connection with operators for better control. Our expected outcome for this year is to design a complete machine that can be applied in practice while ensuring functional integrity. We need to know: knowledge of sound signal collection devices, as well as relevant program editing for control systems, as well as knowledge of mechanics and materials science. We may make breakthroughs in the following aspects: firstly, the detection device may face complex environments and may encounter secondary landslides caused by aftershocks after earthquakes. We need to consider the material strength of the robot itself and the compressive structure of the detector to improve; Secondly, for unexpected situations that may arise in unknown environments, we should also prepare in advance; Finally, we consider adding an autonomous adjustment system that can autonomously make optimal adjustments in the face of unknown situations, at least achieving automatic obstacle avoidance.
